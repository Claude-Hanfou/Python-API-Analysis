# Python-API-Project

## Part 1- WeatherPy

## Baackground
This is a detailes annalysis of the weather 500 random cities based on latitude and longitude using a series of successive API calls from the OpenWeather API

## Obsevable Trends
* From the analysis we can see that the highest temparature is found a 0 latitude and temperature drop is affected by latitude increase or decrease. This affects equatorial regions as they receive direct sunlight

* Southern Hemisphere temparatures tend to be slightly milder in comparison to those at similar latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. This could be attributed tothe Southern Hemisphere having significantly more ocean and much less land.

* Also, Lattitude has no considerable impact on wind speed. The speed of the wind is controlled by the strength of the air pressure gradient, the stronger the pressure gradient the higher the wind speed.
